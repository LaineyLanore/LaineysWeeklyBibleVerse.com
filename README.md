  <h1>Hello everyone!</h1>
  This website will give the glory to God and only God.
  On this website we wil pray for the prodigals and the sick.
  We will do what is right and praise God for the victorys on the mountain top and we will praise Him even louder in the valley. 
  I hope you enjoy this website and I hope that this helps you grow with God.
  Glory to God, Lainey Lanore
